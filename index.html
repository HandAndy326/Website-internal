        <h1>Honey</h1>
        <body>
            Honey is a natural sweetener made by bees from flower nectar, rich in sugars like fructose and glucose. It contains antioxidants, has antibacterial properties, and is used in cooking, medicine, and skincare. Raw honey retains more nutrients than processed honey. It has a long shelf life if stored properly and can crystallize but is easily liquefied by warming.
